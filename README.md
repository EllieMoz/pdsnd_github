### Project Title
Udacity-bikeshare-project

### Description
As a prerequisite to completing the Programming for Data Science with Python Nanodegree Program from Udacity, a project was undertaken to analyze bikeshare data from three major cities in the US: Chicago, New York City, and Washington. The data covers the first half of 2017 and was analyzed using Pandas Dataframe and the Time module for time analysis.

The analysis prompts the user to select the city, month, and day of the week to be analyzed. Results of the analysis include identifying the most popular month, day of the week, and start hour, as well as the most popular start and end stations and the most frequent combination of start to end stations. The total and average travel times, user types and gender counts (if applicable), and birth year statistics are also displayed. If necessary, the first five individual trip data can be displayed, along with additional data if requested.

### Files used
The files used are chicago.csv, new_york_city.csv and washington.csv

### Credits
Biggest thanks to Kam, the Udacity course and RMIT.
